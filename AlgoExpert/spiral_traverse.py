"""Write a function that takes in a "n x m" two-dimensional array (that can be square shaped when n = m) and returns a
one-dimensional array of all the elements in spiral-order.

Spiral order starts in the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes to the right, and proceeds in spiral
pattern all the way until every element has been visited.

Sample Input
------------
array = [
    [1, 2, 3, 4],
    [12 ,13, 14, 5],
    [11, 16, 15, 6],
    [10, 9, 8, 7]
]

Sample Output
-------------
[1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]
